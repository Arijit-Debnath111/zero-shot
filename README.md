# zero-shot
It's under Machine Learning(ML) which is used to predict objects into classes which are difficult for classification. 
So I have been reading about stuffs like colour recognition and also some of stuffs like recognition of diseases which come under machine learning and then I knew about the zero shot learning.
It's basically classify objects that are negligible or difficult to recognize.
I have been also reading or came to know from a reaserch scholar who is currently working on zero shot learning that they are working on image processing with the help of zero shot learning like the image which is difficult to recognize in cctv cameras are recognized through zero shot learning
